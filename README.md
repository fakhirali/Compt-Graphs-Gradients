# Gradient Calculation using Computation Graph


TODO:
- [x] Support addition of gradients during backward prop  
- [x] Support reduce functions like sum, max, min etc.
- [x] Support matrix operations
- [x] Train a NN on MNIST 
- [x] Figure out slicing
- [x] Test every form of gradient using pytorch

Notes:
Slicing does not really work
There is no transpose
